    <p class="lead my-3">While experiemnting with variaous long distance communication modes in amateur radio world, Earth Moon Earth (EME) stood out as one of the most challenging, rewarding, and technilogically all encompassing projects. We started building a EME station for ourselves and share the love with the world so that others can use what we build, kids can learn about space, weather, radio communication, electricity, and technology enthusiasts can join in building reproducible EME stations, DX chaser facilities, comprehensive weather monitoring and analysis capabilities, space exploration through electromagnetic waves and unleash curiosity and creativity. EME is not new, but we now have more advanced computational technology, more advanced Digital Signal Processing, and the new Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, we are taking a baby step forward and redoing most aspects of EME by using technologies we have at our disposal. The basic background of EME can be found here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth–Moon–Earth_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth–Moon–Earth_communication</a></p>

	The major fun and main chgallenge of EME communication is huge loss in reflected signal strength. It is ~240 dB. Every 3 dB loss halves the signal strength. So 240 dB loss is equivalent of 1 unit getting reduced to <math> <mn>2</mn><sup>-80</sup></math> unit. And then comes the latency. The signal propagation time from Earth to the Moon and back ranges between 2.4 and 2.7 seconds. These limitations make EME technically very challenging and rewarding. The equipments need to be capable of dealing with efficient signal propagation, weak signal reception, and decoding the weak signal meaningfully. We can group the challenges into three categories. Limitations, choices with trade-offs and QSO planning.
		<ul>
			<h5>Limitations</h5>
			<li>Loss of signal strength in full path propagation</li>
			<li>Noise accumulation</li>
			<li>Farade rotation</li>
			<li>Position of Sun</li>
			<li>Position of Moon wrt Earth</li>
			<li>Position of Moon wrt QTH</li>
	  </ul>
	
	  <ul><h5>Choices with Trade-Offs</h5>
		  <li>Choice of the frequency</li>
		  <li>Choice of polarization</li> 
		  <li>Choice of Antenna Size, Type and Numbers</li>
	  </ul>
	  <ul><h5>QSO Planning</h5>
		  <li>Readiness of both QTH</li>
		  <li>Polarization matching</li>
		  <li>Establishing QSO time</li>
	  </ul>
