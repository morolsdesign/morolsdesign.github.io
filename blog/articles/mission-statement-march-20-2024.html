        <p>Amateur Radio is a multi-faculty platform for open innnovation. It includes but not limited to RF, computer science, physics, electronics, astronomy, weather, and geodesi. Coupled with the need for expert craftmanship, radio operating techniques, antenna handling, and sense of sportmanship makes amateur radio interesting. Aaron (KM6BSO), an amateur radio operator since he was a child, started this initiative along with his father (K2ATC) to promote and drive open innovation in and around amateur radio technolgies.</p>
        
        <p>Why is it named space-rf? Radio wave travels through space. Except for line of sight communication, radio wave propagation is heavily influenced by the ionosphere and its layers - namely F, E and D. HF propagation makes use of the characterstics of these layers. For more distant communication like earth-moon-earth (EME) and meteor scatter, it has to travel through further deep space. In other words, we have to know and discover more about space in order to use and innovate radio technologies and techniques. That's the origin of Space-RF. </p>
